# Best-Classification-AI
This project is an extension of my senior thesis.

This is a program that is able to read a CSV given by the user and perform analysis on different supervisioned AI classification models and optimization techniques, comparing the resulting F1-Score, processing time and memory usage.
The graphs of the analysis are provided though a series of images and be extracted at the results image folder.

Run the .jar file to open the program.

# ATENTION
- Your CSV must allow for supervisioned classification AIs and must have the y (target variable) column as the last column of the CSV. This program does not perform data cleaning.
