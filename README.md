# Best-Classification-AI
This project is an extension of my senior thesis.

This is a program that is able to get a CSV given by the user and perform an analysis on different supervisioned AI classification models and optimization techniques.
The results of the analysis are provided though a series of imagines

# ATENTION
Your CSV must allow for supervisioned classification AIs and must have the y (target variable) column as the last column of the CSV. This code does not perform data cleaning.

# This project is still in development
