# Overview
You are able to test your own classification model against the others here. This could lead to some erros, so be mindful of the requirements.


# Requirements
Your file must be located in this folder and be named "custom AI model.py"
Your code must contain a class, only the first class of the code will be considered
Your model must be able to handle the X and y inputs being numpy arrays
Your class must contain the following methods:
- fit
- predict
- predict_proba or decision_function

# Disclaimer
You won't be able to use grid-search or random-search unless you implement it at the configurate optimization folder. Tests that include optimization will skip the custom model.
